This repo is the public build of a site I'm doing for a friend. It's a largely informational site, but features an admin dashboard that allows for the upload of pictures for rendering on a for sale section.
It also features a working contact form, which will currently email back the "your email" field. The recipients can be changed in the MailService as needed.
This site was written in Java, under the Spring Boot framework, and using JSP and Bootstrap for the front end.
