This repo is the public build of a site I'm doing for a friend. It's a largely informational site, but features an admin dashboard that allows for the upload of pictures for rendering on a for sale section.
It also features a working contact form, which will currently email back the "your email" field. The recipients can be changed in the MailService as needed.
This site was written in Java, under the Spring Boot framework, and using JSP and Bootstrap for the front end. 

All images on this repo were used as styling content, for school purposes. None of the images shown here are mine, deployed to production, or utilized in any way other than style placeholders. Should anyone see their photos here, then thank you, and I will gladly remove them as you see fit.
